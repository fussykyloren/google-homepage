# Google-Homepage Project
## Information
In this project, I will deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. The goal of this project is to think about how elements are placed, styled and aligned on a page.
This project is from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).
